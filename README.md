# Unofficial KVV Tram Observation

This is an unoffical web app, which uses the KVV Live API to get the current positions of every train on a route. It generates a html page with a map which can be viewed in the index.html. 

The webapp will generate every 30 sec a new map and the index.html file will refresh the map after 30 sec.
